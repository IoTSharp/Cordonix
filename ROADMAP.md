# Cordonix Roadmap

Baseline: 2026-10-29, Asia/Shanghai. IDs below are project planning IDs, not GitHub issues or pull requests.

## Completion standard

An item is complete only when the real product entry point exercises it and its gate has evidence. Source review, builds, native tests, MCP interoperability, performance, recovery, Linux filesystem behavior, packaging and release are separate gates.

Progress: ✅ complete within the stated boundary · 🟡 partial · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ planned. Receipts retain PASS, FAIL, UNKNOWN and NOT_RUN separately.

## Deliveries

| ID | Delivery | Status | Dependencies | Acceptance | Evidence / boundary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CDX-01 | Project charter, name and public contracts | ✅ complete | none | Name, rules, documentation and license | Cordonix/cdx, eight agent rules, Apache-2.0 and bilingual README |
| CDX-02 | C11 Windows process core | ✅ Windows MVP | CDX-01 | Typed argv, Job ownership, timeout/cancel, bounded output | 15 real native-process checks; broader workloads/soak remain separate |
| CDX-03 | Encoding-safe document core | ✅ Windows MVP | CDX-01 | UTF-8/BOM, UTF-16 BOM, explicit CP936, SHA, exact edits and commits | 36 core checks and explicit lossless memory transcoding |
| CDX-04 | C CLI and deterministic JSON contract | ✅ Windows MVP | CDX-02, CDX-03 | Native binary, UTF-8 JSON, original IDs, no shell parsing | CLI request/version and 46 JSON checks |
| CDX-05 | C MCP stdio adapter | ✅ Windows MVP | CDX-04 | Real stdio, asynchronous cancellation, official SDK and Codex | Local stdio gate; earlier baseline had 14 SDK workflows and fresh Codex open/read/search/close |
| CDX-06 | Memory workspace | ✅ bounded single-file MVP | CDX-03 | Reuse open documents, memory editing/search, explicit commit/conflict | Windows 25 encoding/integration edge checks; external programs read disk |
| CDX-07 | Linux POSIX backend | 🟡 local MVP implemented | CDX-02, CDX-04 | Process ownership and encoding/file parity | WSL Ubuntu native process/document/JSON/MCP integration; independent Linux adoption and metadata parity remain open |
| CDX-08 | Packaging and repeatable releases | 🟡 dual publication complete; signing separate | CDX-05 | Portable packages, provenance, SBOM, install/update guide and signed release | v0.0.1 published to GitHub/Gitee with ten identical assets; updater source/gates ready for v0.0.2; signing remains open |
| CDX-09 | Replace overlapping local agent tools with cdx | 🟡 gradual adoption | CDX-05, CDX-06 | Retire predecessors after real capability coverage | Local execution and encoding-aware edits use cdx first; specialized adapters remain for gaps |

## Current parallel tasks

The process and document agents own disjoint platform sources. The packaging agent owns package scripts. The supervising agent owns shared protocol, integration, documents and final gates; independent review findings return to the owning task before closure.

| Task | Scope | Status | Acceptance / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| CDX-07A | POSIX process backend and native fixtures | ✅ local gate passed | 16 real process checks; cleanup is limited to the created group and incomplete observations remain explicit |
| CDX-07B | POSIX documents and shared edit core | ✅ local gate passed | 42 file checks, ASan/UBSan/leak detection, four SHA-256 known vectors |
| CDX-07C | Linux CLI/MCP, builds and final integration | ✅ local gate passed | Linux 183/183 and Windows 197/197; real stdio cancellation/EOF/output blocking/SIGTERM and readable titles |
| CDX-07D | Independent Linux adoption and filesystem metadata | ⬜ planned | Fresh Codex session, ext4 acceptance, ACL/xattr policy and broader workloads |
| CDX-08A | Windows/Linux portable packages | ✅ local gate passed | Identical Windows ZIP from two runs plus Linux tar.gz, SHA-256 metadata, install/update docs and runtime readback |
| CDX-08B | Tagged dual-platform releases | ✅ v0.0.1 published and read back | Windows/Linux native CI and GitHub Release PASS; Gitee recovery PASS; ten identical assets from both sources |
| CDX-08C | Release signing | ⬜ planned | Signing identity and independent signature verification; checksum verification does not close this gate |
| CDX-08D | Installers and hourly user updates | 🚧 local gates complete; v0.0.2 release pending | Windows 12 and Linux 14 installer checks, stable entries, no downgrade and failed-update preservation; persistent user scheduler registration separate |
| CDX-09A | Local execution and encoding-aware edit migration | ✅ local policy updated | Retired PowerShell execution skill; known GBK opens explicitly as CP936 before editing |
| CDX-09B | Remaining Native Tools adapters | ⬜ planned | Evaluate create-file, environment overrides and parsed rg/Git adapters before retirement |
| CDX-09C | Native line-range reading | ✅ local gate passed | One-shot read_file and memory workspace_read line mode; 16 shared real MCP checks; unchanged-SHA comparisons for TableStore.cs Skip 950 / First 245 and encoding_posix.c First 100 |
| CDX-09D | Native tail and complete-text reading | ✅ local gate passed | 14 shared MCP checks; real Tail 55 and Raw examples match PowerShell with unchanged source SHAs; over-budget complete reads fail explicitly |
| CDX-09E | Native directory listing and path resolution | ✅ local gate passed | 12 shared MCP checks; hidden/system entries, limits, normalization and explicit missing paths; existing-directory comparison matches PowerShell |
| CDX-09F | Native batch encoding verification | ✅ local gate passed | 14 shared MCP checks; seven distinct CP936 fixtures match .NET strict verification without writes; scope/count preflight, BOM mismatch, timeout/cancel/EOF and NOT_RUN evidence |

## Next item

Publish installer/update support as a new v0.0.2 tag, preserve v0.0.1 and independently verify a real 0.0.1-to-0.0.2 update. Verify the new runtime in a fresh Codex session, including whether the client displays MCP titles. CDX-07D, CDX-08C and CDX-09B retain their own acceptance evidence.

## Capability gaps

| ID | Reproduction / scale | Expected and actual | Owner | Blocked scope | Closing evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GAP-01 | C core packaging | Reusable header/library and native executable | maintainers | Windows MVP | ✅ native build and process checks |
| GAP-02 | Memory edits and external compiler reads | Explicit commit materializes memory before external execution | maintainers | Windows MVP | ✅ MCP edit/convert/commit/readback |
| GAP-03 | External writer during final replacement | Hash/identity checks prior changes; no filesystem compare-and-swap | maintainers | stronger transaction guarantees | 🟡 documented limitation; no speculative locking |
| GAP-04 | Crash before memory commit | Uncommitted session data is discarded | maintainers | crash recovery | ⬜ no journal or implicit writes |
| GAP-05 | Performance/token/physical-I/O claims | Measure fixed workloads first | maintainers | public performance claims | ⬜ not measured; logical counters only |
| GAP-06 | File creation and execution environment overrides | Existing tools cover memory edits and inherited environments | maintainers | retirement of remaining adapters | ⬜ retain predecessors until each gap has a real gate |
| GAP-07 | Readable tool titles in Codex | tools/list includes title; UI selection belongs to the client | maintainers/client | dynamic per-call labels | 🟡 protocol title readback passes; fresh Codex rendering and dynamic labels UNKNOWN |
